[Bootstrap Template for HTML Email](http://github.com/AdvancedREI/BootstrapForEmail)
=================

Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development, created and maintained by [Mark Otto](http://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](http://twitter.com/fat) at Twitter.

To get started, checkout http://getbootstrap.com!


Bootstrap for Email utilizes LESS to create a stylesheet containing a subset of the Bootstrap styles that can be displayed in an e-mail. It's for companies that use Bootstrap on their web applications and want to send out branded e-mails as well (seems like a no-brainer, right?)

Anything that uses JavaScript is left out, leaving you with an e-mail page suitable for running through [Premailer](http://premailer.dialect.ca/) before sending.

We're using Bootstrap 2.3.2.

Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/advancedrei/BootstrapForEmail.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/advancedrei/bootstrapforemail/zipball/master).

Drop these files in with your Bootstrap LESS files, and it will automatically pick up the proper @imports. Or just use the pre-baked output. There is also a template.html file in the root that utilizes the visual concepts in the Bootstrap samples, replicated in HTML 4.01.
